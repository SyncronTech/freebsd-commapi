FreeBSD java comm api
=====================

This is the final resting place for FreeBSD commapi. I'm putting
this here for historical purposes, as the javacomm API itself has
retired years ago. Last time I checked there was no official
download for javacomm jars any more.

This stuff used to be available at [syncrontech.org][2]

I myself have moved on using [purejavacomm][1].
