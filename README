Serial Support
--------------

Serial support is mainly completed thanks to gary R. Shaffer who made 90% of
the work and gently donated it.

Demos are working perfectly with this code. It can nearly be considered as
final-release.

Parallel Support
----------------

Parallel support is currently limited to writing bytes to the port in SPP
mode only. This is ideal to command printers and electronic devices.

PS/2 mode will soon be available and EPP/SPP later.

TODO
---
Parallel: SPP/EPP support
Serial  : capture of the BI,FE,OE,PE, OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY events.
