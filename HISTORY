Version 0.7

   - Get paraller port include files from /usr/include/dev, not from /sys/dev.

Version 0.6

   - Turn on CLOCAL flag to avoid hangs when modem signals change.
     (is this good or not ?)
   - Fixed first argument to select

Version 0.5

   - Use select(2) instead of poll(2). For some reason,
     the poll didn't work with diablo-jdk 1.3 but select does.
     Select does not work on older native jdk 1.2, so this
     change makes this package broken for that jdk. If someone
     still wants to use jdk 1.2 then FreeBSD commapi 0.4 must be used.

Version 0.4

   - Serial port supports debugging by setting 
     system property "org.freebsd.io.comm.debug" to "true".
   - Background threads are now daemon threads. This was
     not the case in earlier versions, which caused programs
     not to stop normally. Thanks for Sebastiaan van Erk <sebster@sebster.com>
     for pointing this out.

Version 0.3

   - Support for USB ucom devices added.

Version 0.2

   - Offset bug in read/write fixed
   - Compiles with native FreeBSD jdk 1.4.0 alpha
   - Uses BSD make to compile

Version 0.1

   - First version of source code by various contributors.
     See original README.
