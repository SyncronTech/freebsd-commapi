Version 0.4

   - Serial port supports debugging by setting 
     system property "org.freebsd.io.comm.debug" to "true".
   - Background threads are now daemon threads. This was
     not the case in earlier versions, which caused programs
     not to stop normally. Thanks for Sebastiaan van Erk <sebster@sebster.com>
     for pointing this out.

Version 0.3

   - Support for USB ucom devices added.

Version 0.2

   - Offset bug in read/write fixed
   - Compiles with native FreeBSD jdk 1.4.0 alpha
   - Uses BSD make to compile

Version 0.1

   - First version of source code by various contributors.
     See original README.
